            <p>A lot of this will likely be review if you're at all familiar with the concept of pointers but it's good
                to
                cover our bases anyways.</p>

            <h3>What is a pointer?</h3>

            <p>Simply put, a pointer is an object that stores the
                <u>memory address</u> of another object. This is useful for a lot of reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It allows you to pass by reference instead of copying (duplicating) objects when you want to pass
                    them
                    to a function.</li>
                <li>It allows you to change the value of a variable outside your current scope. As long as you have
                    apointer
                    to it, you can access the object's memory.</li>
                <li>It allows you to store a collection of polymorphic objects as long as the type the collection stores
                    is
                    a class all objects inherit from.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>There are more reasons to use pointers, but these are the main ones. Starting with the most basic form of
                a
                pointer in C++, the <b>raw pointer</b>, let's see how we might use one:</p>
            <br />
            <code>
            <pre>
void addNumbers(int a, int b, int* c) {
    *c = a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result;
    addNumbers(4, 5, &result);
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0; 
}
            </pre>
        </code>
        </section>
