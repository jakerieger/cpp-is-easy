            <p>A lot of this will likely be review if you're at all familiar with the concept of pointers but it's good
                to
                cover our bases anyways.</p>

            <h3>What is a pointer?</h3>
            <p>Simply put, a pointer is an object that stores the
                <u>memory address</u> of another object. This is useful for a lot of reasons:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ol>
                <li>It allows you to pass by reference instead of copying (duplicating) objects when you want to pass
                    them
                    to a function.</li>
                <li>It allows you to change the value of a variable outside your current scope. As long as you have
                    a pointer
                    to it, you can access the object's memory.</li>
                <li>It allows you to store a collection of polymorphic objects as long as the type the collection stores
                    is
                    a class all objects inherit from.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>There are certainly more reasons to use pointers, but these are usually the main ones you'll run into.
            </p>
            <p>Let's start with the most basic form of pointer in C++, the <u>raw</u> pointer, and take a look at each
                one of the cases above.</p>
            <br />

            <h3>1. Pass by reference</h3>
            <p>Passing a variable by reference is probably the single most common use of pointers in C/C++.</p>
            <blockquote>
                Yes, C++ has a literal "reference" operator <code>(&)</code>, but this is not what I'm referring to.
                I'm simply using
                the term to describe the concept
                of a reference.
            </blockquote>
            <pre><code data-language="c">
void addReference(int* a, int* b, int* c) {
    *c = *a + *b;
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    int c;
    addReference(&a, &b, &c); // The result of 'a + b' is now stored in c
    printf("%d\n", c);        // "30"

    return 0;
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>One nice feature of this method is that it allows your function to return a type different than that of
                the data your function modifies. For example, you might want to return a boolean value to denote whether
                the action succeeded or failed,
                preventing the user from accessing the modified data in an instance where the data is likely invalid:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre><code data-language="c">
int main() {
    char* data = new char[2048];

    if (!doSomethingWithData(data)) {
        delete[] data; // clean memory and terminate, data is invalid
        return -1;
    }

    // Do something with data since we know it's valid

    delete[] data;
    return 0;
}
            </code></pre>


            <h3>2. Modification outside scope</h3>
            <pre><code data-language="c">
int* x; /* stores the memory address of an integer */
            </code></pre>

            <h3>3. Polymorphic containers</h3>
            <pre><code data-language="c">
int* x; /* stores the memory address of an integer */
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Smart Pointers</h3>
            <p>With the advent of C++11, we got a new way of working with pointers: <i>smart</i> pointers.</p>
